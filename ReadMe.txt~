1) List what you have completed:

Core: 
  - Read all the provided geometry files. DONE
  - Each object must be positioned as shown in Figure 1. DONE
  - Each object must have an assigned material. DONE: Since I used opengl3.3
	with my	own code. I loaded these properties in as uniforms in the shader
	program.
  - Texture parameters must be used efficiently. DONE I used a 1 pixel texture
	for diffuse color so as not to have to use too many shaders programs. And
	yes wood and brick etc. 
  - Have four light sources. DONE though I didn't have an ambient light, just
	ambient properties for lights and materials
Completion:
  - There must be an icon representing the spotlight. DONE but I didn't have
	access to GLU so my lamp is just something I made in blender and has a flat
	unshaded shader. Directional and and point lights are present though
	lighting seems to look very different on different lcd panels.
  - There must be interactive controls for the spot light. DONE press 'L' to go
	into lamp mode :P mouse adjusts the angle of light. Arrow keys and pgUp,pgDn
	keys move the light around the scene. scrollwheel norrows and widens the
	beam.
  - Metallic objects (the sphere and teapot) will have mirror like reflections
	on them. DONE though I forgot to put the cubeMap on the sphere... ooops
  - If the ’t’ key is pressed... Um instead I made the camera switch between
	centre/look/rotate and free view with 'wasd' and mouse look. to switch
	between press 'V'. note: you can't use 'L' when free camera mode and vice
	versa.

Challenge
  - The entire scene will be rendered using Phong shading. DONE with multiple
	light sourses

2) List any additional modifications that are not in the brief:

  - I implemented this all in opengl 3.3 and only used some of the code in the
	Assignment 3 Materials.

3) How to run your code, if it differs from the original assignment:

    I made an Eclipse makefile (not cmake) project which worked on the ECS
	machines but I haven't tried compiling from the commandline. I have used
	and compiled this code on ECS machines and at home so it should work on the
	linux platform.
